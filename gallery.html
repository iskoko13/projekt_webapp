                        <p>
                        Rowling has described Hermione as a strong female character who is bright, logical, upright and good. Rowling was seen as a "know-it-all" in her youth, and she said Hermione is an exaggerated version of her younger self. She added that beneath Hermione's studious exterior, she is insecure and afraid of failure, traits which are inspired by Rowling's own youthful insecurity. According to Rowling, Hermione is the perfect expository character due to her encyclopaedic knowledge of the wizarding world.

                        <h2>Lord Voldemort</h2>
                        <p>
                        Voldemort, an anagrammatic sobriquet for his birth name Tom Marvolo Riddle, is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has "the power to vanquish the Dark Lord". After killing Harry's parents, Lily and James Potter, he attempts to murder the boy, but instead leaves him with a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt. Nearly every witch or wizard dares not utter his name and refers to him instead with such monikers as "You-Know-Who", "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", or "The Dark Lord". Voldemort's obsession with blood purity signifies his aim to rid the wizarding world of Muggle (non-magical) heritage and to conquer both worlds, Muggle and wizarding, to achieve pure-blood dominance.
