                        <p>
                            Almost any list of modern violin greats will include Hilary Hahn. She started studying
                            violin at just 4 years old, and eventually joined the Curtis Institute of Music. Hahn was
                            considered a true child prodigy. She performed with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra at 12,
                            and debuted at Carnegie Hall when she was only 16. Hahn has performed all over the world,
                            including at the Vatican for Pope Benedict XVI. She has won three Grammy Awards.

                            was leading the National Children’s Orchestra of Great Britain. In her teens, she won
                            multiple national awards in recognition of her talents as a musical prodigy. Benedetti has
                            toured with orchestras around the globe and received countless awards for her performances.
                            She’s known not just for her talents, but also for an exuberant playing style that has

                            If you’re a classical music fan, you know the name Joshua Bell. One of the most famous
                            violinists of modern times, Bell developed an interest in classical music before he even
                            started school. After years of intense study, he debuted at Carnegie Hall when he was only
                            17. His performance on the score of the Academy Award-winning 1998 film The Red Violin
                            earned him the attention of the wider world.

                            Japanese violinist Akiko Suwanai began studying the instrument at just 3 years old. After
                            studying at Juilliard, she made history in 1990, becoming the youngest-ever champion of
                            Moscow’s Tchaikovsky Competition at 18. Suwanai is known for her broad repertoire and
                            extraordinary technical skill, making her a standout even amongst the most talented
                            musicians in the world.

                        <p>
                            Augustin Hadelich managed to become one of the most skilled violinists in the world without
                            receiving an early formal education on the instrument. Most professional instrumentalists
                            start studying before they even enter school, but Hadelich didn’t have that option.
                            Fascinated by the violin, though, he took sporadic lessons from adults who traveled by his
                            family’s farm. Finally, he was able to study at renowned music schools in Italy and New
                            York. Hadelich has performed around the world and has earned four Grammy nominations.
